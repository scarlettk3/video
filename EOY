So even if I ask days later also will it respond correctly? I want understand this because I have built an agent with langraph to give kubectl commands which has buttons to edit and execute and solve cluster vulnerabilities by hydrating a matched generic ansible template I have provided and it also has validate, execute buttons etc. it also answers general questions . I want to build it as a conversational ai but it became a question and answer only like I said my name but when I asked what is my name it wasn't giving it. Can you tell me why? And upon understanding the above conversation ai I found that mine is not built like that, can you help me what to do to make it conversational .
